**Technologies used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Next steps:**
  Would love to add a 'Back' button if the player wants to go back to a previous question to update their answer.
  Would love to add a 'Start Over' button on the game loss result message, so the player doesn't have to refresh the page -- currently it's not intuitive that you have to refresh the page to get a new game.
  Would love to incorporate a picture element on the game win result message, so that you see a photo of Oasis or a music video.
