/* Peusdocode for my Oasis quiz game:

1. The game will be a 5-question quiz on one of the UK's best bands of all time!
2. You must get at least 4 questions correct in order to win the game.
3. If you get 3 or more questions incorrect, you must start over from the beginning.
4. Each question will have 4 multiple choices that you can choose from.
5. Once you select your answer for each question, you'll have the option to move forward with a 'Next' button at the botton of your quiz container section.
6. After you submit your answer for the fifth question, you'll be redirected to a new screen within the quiz container that states whether you lost the game or won the game. 
    6a. If you won the game, you'll hear a song from Oasis.
    6b. If you lose, the prompt will ask you to 'Start over' and you'll hear a song from Blur.
